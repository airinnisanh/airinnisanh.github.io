                        My name is Airinnisa Nur Hidayati, people call me either Airin or Nisa. I’m the first daughter in the family and I have two younger siblings that I adore so much. My friends say that I have too much energy to spend so pardon me if I talk too much on this page :D 
                    </p>

                        I have pretty much spent the most of my time on the internet, hence I decided to contribute my live in the same field that I’m familiar with. It took me less than 4 years (3 years 10 months and 26 days, to be pretty exact) to gain a bachelor degree from Institut Teknologi Bandung. My major was Information System and Technology, the students from my major were trained to be jack of all trades, we learned pretty much everything about technology but as the son of the generation we have to choose one for us to be specialized in, in order to be useful to the generation.

                    Hahah! Hello! It’s me again! Welcome to another episode of TMI (too much information) with me :D not that I’m complaining. This time I’m going to tell a story about how a young girl with dreams trying to find her passion.

                    Once upon a time, in a far far away town (Bekasi), lived a young girl that has dreams. She’s kinda passionate about everything, she’s always excited whenever she’s doing a new thing, she wanted to do everything (like, literally, EVERYTHING). She once tried mathematics then she was (quite literally) CRAZY about it. She once tried to code then she got ADDICTED to it. She once tried to do makeup and then she couldn’t get her hands off it. She once tried to bake then she made a bakery on her own. Doing things excites her, there’s nothing that she doesn’t want to try, until she got trapped inside a dark dark well, named reality. She has to choose one to make for her own living, but she had the struggle to pick ONLY ONE…
